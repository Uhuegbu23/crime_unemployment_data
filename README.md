## Crime Data Analysis from Three Cities, Nashville, TN, Birmingham, AL, and Louisville, KY
#### Executive Summary
My capstone analyzed crime data and police call-for-service records in three cities: Nashville, Tennessee; Louisville, Kentucky; and Birmingham, Alabama. The overarching goal is to understand how certain crime are prevalent in each of these stat while making a comparison. I wanted to understand the crime rate by Zip code and how that compares across each state. While my tool was Python, I analyzed crime data to identify patterns in criminal activities such as theft, drug, car theft, burglary, assault, vandalism, and more within the selected cities. My capstone represented a comprehensive effort to understand public safety concerns. The results provided valuable insights that informs policy decisions and law enforcement strategies aimed at improving public safety and quality of life in metro cities in the south of America. 

Additionally, the analysis focused on identifying trends and potential areas of focus for policy makers and law enforcement agencies. I examined whether certain crimes are more prevalent in areas with higher unemployment or if population density has a significant impact on the types of service calls received by the police. The data from Nashville, TN, provided by the Metro Nashville Police Department, Information Technology, gave details about crime data from the Metro Nashville Police Department. For Louisville, KY, the Crime report data is provided for Louisville Metro Police Divisions only, while that of Birmingham, AL, is provided by four different police precincts, East, West, North, and South Police Precincts. 

#### Motivation

I chose these crime data because I believed that crime data analysis will provide valuable insights into the patterns, trends, and factors influencing criminal activities in various regions. My proposal outlined a data analysis project to analyze crime data and records in three cities: Nashville, Tennessee; Louisville, Kentucky; and Birmingham, Alabama. I selected the cities of Nashville, Louisville, and Birmingham due to their diverse demographic profiles and distinct geographic locations. Again, these cities are in the South of the United States, close to each other, and probably have a similar population. Furthermore, these cities have robust data collection and reporting systems, ensuring the availability of comprehensive and reliable data for the project. 

#### Data Question
These are some of the questions I have in mind: 

* What are the most common types of crimes reported in each of the three cities, and how do they compare?
* How do the rates of violent crimes, such as and simple assault aggravated assault, compare across the three cities?
* Are there any discernible patterns in the times of day or days of the week when crimes are most frequently reported in each city?
* Are there a particular crime that can be related to certain geography of people?

* What are the patterns and correlations between unemployment rates, and crime rates in Nashville, Louisville, and Birmingham, and how do these factors influence the crime data?
* Are there specific month, week day where there is higher or lower crime rate than other months or days of the week? and how does these compare in the three cities?

* What time of the day does car theft or any other type of crime happen most?
