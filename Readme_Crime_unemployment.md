Crime Data from Three Cities, Nashville, TN, Birmingham, AL, and Louisville, KY
Executive Summary
My capstone will analyze crime data and police call-for-service records in three cities: Nashville, Tennessee; Louisville, Kentucky; and Birmingham, Alabama. The project will also incorporate unemployment rate and population data from these cities to explore potential correlations and patterns. The overarching goal is to understand how economic and demographic factors influence crime rates and the demand for police services in these urban areas. While my tools would be Excel to join the Birmingham Data, SQL, and Python, I hope to analyze historical crime data to identify patterns in criminal activities such as theft, burglary, assault, vandalism, and more within the selected cities. My capstone represents a comprehensive effort to understand the complex interplay between economic conditions, demographic factors, and public safety concerns. I anticipate that the results will provide valuable insights that can inform policy decisions and law enforcement strategies aimed at improving public safety and quality of life in metro cities in the south of America. 
Additionally, the analysis will focus on identifying trends and potential areas of focus for policy makers and law enforcement agencies. I will examine whether certain crimes are more prevalent in areas with higher unemployment or if population density has a significant impact on the types of service calls received by the police. 
The data from Nashville, TN, is provided by the Metro Nashville Police Department, Information Technology, giving details about emergency and non-emergency calls for Metro Nashville Police Department service received by the Emergency Communications Center. For Louisville, KY, the Crime report data is provided for Louisville Metro Police Divisions only, while that of Birmingham, AL, is provided by four different police precincts, East, West, North, and South Police Precincts. 
Motivation
I have chosen these crime data because I believe that crime data analysis will provide valuable insights into the patterns, trends, and factors influencing criminal activities in various regions. My proposal outlines a data analysis capstone project to analyze crime data and police call-for-service records in three cities: Nashville, Tennessee; Louisville, Kentucky; and Birmingham, Alabama. I selected the cities of Nashville, Louisville, and Birmingham due to their diverse demographic profiles and distinct geographic locations. Again, these cities are in the South of the United States, close to each other, and probably have a similar population. Furthermore, these cities have robust data collection and reporting systems, ensuring the availability of comprehensive and reliable data for the project. 
Data Question
These are some of the questions I have in mind: 

What are the most common types of crimes reported in each of the three cities, and how do they compare?
How do the rates of violent crimes, such as homicide and aggravated assault, compare across the three cities?
Are there any discernible patterns in the times of day or days of the week when crimes are most frequently reported in each city?
What is the relationship between the type of call for service and the resulting police action in each city?

How do the police response times to calls for service compare across the three cities, and what factors might influence these response times?

How do variations in unemployment rates correlate with crime rates and types of police calls-for-service in Nashville, Louisville, and Birmingham. 

Economic conditions—including poverty, income inequality, and unemployment—are considered important determinants of violent crime and injury. Rates of violence are the highest in neighborhoods characterized by concentrated socioeconomic disadvantage and high-income inequality. Racial disparities in violence and crime have been previously explained in part by higher rates of unemployment and lower wages among Blacks compared with whites.  As demonstrated, the link between crime and economic conditions is complex. 

What are the patterns and correlations between unemployment rates, population density, and crime rates in Nashville, Louisville, and Birmingham, and how do these factors influence the demand for police call-for-service or crime rate?

I would also look at the crime rate per 100, 000 people, and possibly do a crime rate comparison to employment rate. The data for population and unemployment are not as huge as the crime data sets. 

I am also interested in analyzing whether higher unemployment rates are associated with specific types of crime or increased overall crime rates. Additionally, I could investigate if there is a pattern in the types of police calls-for-service that are more common in areas with higher unemployment rates.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
I also would examine the temporal aspects of crime, including daily, weekly, and monthly variations, to identify peak times and seasonal trends. In addition, I would conduct a geospatial analysis (possibly), utilizing Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to map crime hotspots, assess spatial patterns, and identify areas with high crime rates. This capstone will compare crime rates and police responses across the three cities, possibly leading to insights into law enforcement responses to crime in these cities. This could include patterns in response times, the types of incidents that most commonly require a police response, and how these factors correlate with crime rates and trends. Finally, I would do a crime data type correlation between these three cities to investigate potential correlations between different types of crimes and explore whether certain crimes tend to co-occur in specific neighborhoods or timeframes.

Known Issues and Challenges
I am not sure of any issues I might encounter. While I am considering finding 2 years backward of each city instead of just focusing on 2023, I do not see this as an issue or challenge. However, I am thinking of displaying historical data of crime in these cities and look for patterns. I would be interested in knowing what you think.
